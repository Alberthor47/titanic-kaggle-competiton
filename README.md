# Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

This repository contains my notebook for the Titanic Kaggle competition. The goal of this competition is to apply machine learning techniques to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic.

## Project Overview

The Titanic competition is a beginner-friendly challenge that provides a great introduction to data science and machine learning. The dataset includes information about passengers such as age, gender, class, and other features that can be used to predict survival. Further information can be found in the [Kaggle competition page](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/overview).

## Files

- `notebook.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the data analysis, feature engineering, and machine learning model development.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Approach

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understand the dataset and visualize key patterns.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Create new features and preprocess the data.
3. **Model Training:** Train machine learning models to predict survival.
4. **Evaluation:** Assess model performance and optimize for better results.

## Results

The final model achieves an accuracy of **0.7392%** on the test dataset. Further improvements can be made by exploring hyperparameter tuning and a change in the preprocessing steps.
